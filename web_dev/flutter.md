# Flutter

- a cross platform app framework
- strongly typed
- oop

## architecture
- compiles code to native code
- framwork
  - widgets
  - utils

## why 
- dev experience
    - stateful hot reload
- performance
    - directly compiled to machine code
    - does not use native ui primitive
        - no need for bridging (composite the entire screen at once)
        - completely decoupled from OS native behaviour
- declarative UI
    - state driven
    - framework handles rerender

## unit system
- use logical pixel (aka. density-independent pixel)
- pixel mapped to a fixed physical width (1 logical pixel ~= 38px)

## layout mechanism
- principles
    - constraints go down: propagate from parent to children
    - sizes go up: from child to parent
    - position set by parent: each widget cannot determine its own position
- constraints
    - as big as possible: `Container`, `Center`, `ListView`
    - just wrap children: `Transform`, `Opacity`
    - particular size: `Image`, `Text`
    - depend on contraints given (flex boxes): `Column`, `Row`
        - cross direction (horizontal for `column`) must be bounded
- concepts
    - tight vs losse
        - tight: child must be of certain size (e.g. screen -> center)
        - loose: child smaller than certain size (e.g. center -> child)

## layout widgets
- single child
    - `Center`
    - `Container`
- multi child
    - `row`
        - variant `ListTile`
    - `column`
        - variant `ListView`
    - `ListView`
    - `Stack`

## display widgets


## responsive design
- `LayoutBuilder`
- `MediaQuery.of(context)
- AspectRatio
- CustomSingleChildLayout
- CustomMultiChildLayout
- FittedBox
- FractionallySizedBox
- LayoutBuilder
- MediaQuery
- MediaQueryData
- OrientationBuilder`

## Android vs iOS behavior difference
- push a new page
    - android: push navigation: bottom to up 
    - ios: 
        - regular push page: horizontal
        - fullscreen modal: bottom to up
- back navigation
    - android: pop page by the back button of OS
    - ios: pop page by edge swipe
- overscroll 
    - android: show glow indicator
    - ios: snaps back
- return to top:
    - ios: click status bar return to top
- typography:
    - android: roboto
    - ios: san franciso
- haptic feedback
    - android: on field select -> vibrate and 'buzz' sound
    - ios: scrolling through picker items -> light impact sound

## error handling
- runZoneGuarded
    - create an error zone that wraps the app

- isolate.current.addErrorListener: 
	- any errors that may occur within the entry function

- FlutterError.onError
	- layout exceptions (e.g. overflow)
	- anything uncaught during widget build



## The good
- stateful hot reload

## The Bad
- no storybook to showcase design
- widget test done through several pumps
- pumpAndSettle somes doesn't work
	when there is background animation
- Cupertino Switch color cannot be controlled through themes
- popup is a route
- loading image assets
	- can not load nested directories
	- no svg support
- Tab is hardcoding the height
intellij editor Flutter inspector cannot connect
	disable devtools in the flutter section of the editor


## The Ugly
